; This is an example configuration for training a language model.  It is an
; INI file with few added syntanctic restrictions.
;
; Names in square brackets refer to objects in the program. With the exception
; of the [main] block, all of them will be instantiated as objects.
;
; The field values can be of several types:
;
;   * None - interpreted as Python None
;   * True / False - interpreted as boolean values
;   * integers
;   * floating point numbers
;   * python types (fully defined with module name)
;   * references to other objects in the configuration, closed in <>
;   * strings (if it does not match any other pattern)
;   * tuples of the previous enclosed in brackets
;   * list of the previous, enclosed in square brackets, comma-separated
;
; The vocabularies are handled in a special way. If the vocabularies source is
; defined in the [main] (a dataset object) a dictionary that maps the language
; code to the vocabularies is created. Later, if any other block has a field
; called 'vocabulary', and its value is a known language code, the vocabulary
; from the dictionary is used. Vocabularies can be also defined as objects
; in the INI file and can be referenced using the <> notation.
;

[main]
; The main block contains the mandatory fields for running and experiment.
